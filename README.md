# TicTacToe AI

This version of TicTacToe puts the player against an unbeatable AI that uses the minimax algorithm. The best possible outcome for the human player is a draw.

Currently, it is only a CLI but there are plans to convert it into a GUI using wxWidgets hopefully soon.

***Future Updates***
- [x] [GUI](https://github.com/RyanB1/TicTacToeAIGUI)
- [ ] AI vs AI Mode
